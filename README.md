# Python Script Template


This template includes:

- **a single script** that relies on the standard library
- **a parser object** that interacts with a file or stdin
- **a basic logging** configuration that logs to stderr
- **a main function** to isolate the script entry point
- **a line iterator** to remove new lines from the file
- **docstring usage** to document/test your code

You can test your code with this command:

```python3
python3 -m doctest FILE
```

**Happy Python Scripting !**
