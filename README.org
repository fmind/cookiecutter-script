* Python Script Template

This template includes:
- *a single script* that relies on the standard library
- *a parser object* that interacts with a file or stdin
- *a basic logging* configuration that logs to stderr
- *a main function* to isolate the script entry point
- *a line iterator* to remove new lines from the file
- *docstring usage* to document and test your module

You can test your code with the following command:
`python3 -m doctest FILE`

*Happy Python Scripting !*
